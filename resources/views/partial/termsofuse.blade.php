         We will allow

         <li>
            you make request(s) that are unreasonably
            repetitive, require LocaL2LocaL to make a disproportionate technical
            effort (for example, to develop an entirely new system), risk the privacy
            of others, or would be highly impractical to comply with.

         We need to
         prevent information in our systems from being accidentally or maliciously
         destroyed. This means that, where you delete information from our services,
         residual copies of that information on our active servers, as well as any
         corresponding information on our back-up systems, may not be immediately
         deleted.
